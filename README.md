# Through Different Lenses
Group J Artifact - <i>CSE 457 Computer Graphics Spring 2025</i>

## High level description
You are blind and are looking for your glasses in a VR environment. You discover different pairs of glasses as you are searching for your pair; each different pair enables a different texture style for the world. 

## Team assignments
- Dalton - Interactions, shaders, filters. 
- Dom - model, Filters, shaders
- Martin - Modeling
- James - Project Management, XR SDE
  
## Feature list
- Scene augmenting glasses features:
- Near or far sighted  (focus point)
- Sunglasses (Color tint)
- Horror (Model Swap/Animated film Grain)
- Flashlight (Point light and Vignette)
- Beach (Model Swap/Water physics)
- Puzzle with certain combinations of glasses to reveal hints to get to next pair

## Development plan
- Written specification detailing gameplay loop, and expected interaction behaviors.
- Working XR Unity environment: URP with XR interaction toolkit and git LFS.
- Basic scene template with different assets or at least place holders for future developed assets.
- Working interactions driving dummy outputs. 
- Base filter for blurry surrounding environment.
- Three functioning filter/augmenting glasses for an MVP.
- Expand further upon assets; possibly developing multiple more technically ambitious scene augmentation through the in game glasses.

## Checkpoint
A working VR environment with models and interactables, one filter (glasses) that successfully modifies the user view.

## Materials and any external help needed 
- Meta Quest 3
- 3D Assets
- LFS Tokens

## Key Risks and Mitigations

Our project has lots of flexibility baked into the base idea. If we complete our MVP with a few different pairs of some basic scene augmenting glasses, we can dive much deeper into some technically ambitious filters. Of course getting to a more matured state is the goal, but it will not break our project if we can only get part of the way there. The modular nature of the project will allow us to work on as many features as possible right up to the deadline.
